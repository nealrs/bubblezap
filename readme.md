## Bubble Zap

Bubble Zap is the first game I've ever built. Basically, you have 60 seconds to pop 50 bubbles in a 3d space. It's harder than it looks, _if you don't cheat & zoom out_.

This game is an adapted version of the [bubble pop! demo](http://tparisi.github.io/glam/demos/bubblepop.html) from [Tony Parisi's glam (GL And Markup) project](https://github.com/tparisi/glam). All I've done is re-skin it and added some game logic.

I created this game to learn more about glam for Issue 77 of [Git@Me](http://gitat.me).
